Six steps to call C/C++ from Java code

The process of calling C or C ++ from Java programs consists of six steps.
We'll go over each step in depth in the sections that follow, but let's start
with a quick look at each one.

1.  Write the Java code. We'll start by writing Java classes to perform three
tasks: declare the native method we'll be calling; load the shared library
containing the native code; and call the native method.

2.  Compile the Java code. We must successfully compile the Java class or
classes to bytecode before we can use them.

3.  Create the C/C++ header file. The C/C++ header file will declare the native
function signature that we want to call. This header will then be used with the
C/C++ function implementation (see Step 4) to create the shared library (see Step 5).

4.  Write the C/C++ code. This step consists of implementing the function in a
C or C++ source code file. The C/C++ source file must include the header file we
created in Step 3.

5.  Create the shared library file. We'll create a shared library file from the
C source code file we created in Step 4.

6.  Run the Java program. We'll run the code and see if it works. We'll also go
over some tips for dealing with the more commonly occurring errors.
